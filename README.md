# Gutenberg Animate
Add animation to your WordPress Gutenberg blocks.

Use the power of <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animate.css</a> as your Gutenberg blocks as they enter the viewport.
Just add an Animation Block and then put any blocks to be animated into the animation block.
You will need to install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" title="Gutenberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gutenberg plugin</a> first.

`npm start` to watch the files.

`npm run build` to bundle for production.

Big Thanks to packages used.
