# Gutenberg Animate
Add animation to your WordPress Gutenberg blocks.

Add animations to your Gutenberg blocks as they enter the viewport.
Just add an Animation Block and then put any blocks to be animated into the animation block.
Install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" title="Gutenberg" target="_blank">Gutenberg plugin</a>.

`npm start` to watch the files.
